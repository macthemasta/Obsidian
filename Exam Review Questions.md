Select The Correct Answer Below

DLL injection

Resource exhaustion

Race condition

Weak configuration

##### This answer selected is not correct.

### Question Explanation



The Answer: C. Race condition  
A race condition occurs when two processes occur at similar times, usually with unexpected results. The file system problem is usually fixed before a reboot, but a reboot is occurring before the fix can be applied. This has created a race condition that results in constant reboots.  
  
The incorrect answers:  
A. DLL injection  
One method of exploiting an application is to take advantage of the libraries reference by the application rather than the application itself. DLL (Dynamic Link Library) injection manipulates the library as the attack vector.  
  
B. Resource exhaustion  
If the time clock was running out of storage space or memory, it would most likely be unusable. In this example, the issue isn’t based on a lack of resources.  
  
D. Weak configuration  
If the system is poorly configured, there may be unintended access to a service or data. This time clock issue wasn’t related to any misconfiguration or weak configuration on the time clock appliance.

Which of the following BEST describes this configuration?

Select The Correct Answer Below

Affinity

Round-Robin

Airgap

Mantrap

### Question Explanation


A round-robin scheduling scheme allows a load balancer to send requests to servers one after another. Affinity scheduling directs user requests to a specific server based on the user's IP address to ensure that the user accesses the same server during a web session. An airgap ensures that computing systems are physically separated from each other and is unrelated to this question. A mantrap prevents unauthorized entry using the social engineering tactic of tailgating.

21.   Lisa needs to calculate the ALE for a group of servers used in the network. During the past two years, five of the servers failed. The hardware cost to repair or replace each server was$3,500 and the downtime resulted in $2,500 of additional losses for each outage. What is the ALE?

Select The Correct Answer Below

$7,000

$8,000

$15,000

$30,000

##### This answer selected is not correct.

### Question Explanation

The annual loss expectancy (ALE) is $15,000. The single loss expectancy (SLE) is $6,000 ($3,500 to repair or replace each server plus $2,500 in additional losses for each outage). The annual rate of occurrence (ARO) is 2.5 (five failures in two years or 5 I 2). You calculate the ALE as SLE x ARO ($6,000 X 2.5).

Select The Correct Answer Below

Privacy threshold assessment


Privacy impact assessment

Tabletop exercise

Affinity scheduling

### Question Explanation


A privacy threshold assessment helps an organization identify Personally Identifiable Information (PII) within a system, and in this scenario, it would help the organization determine if the customer data is Pll. A privacy impact assessment is done after you have verified that the system is processing Pll, not to determine if the data is PII. A tabletop exercise is a discussion-based exercise used to talk through a continuity of operations plan. Affinity scheduling is a load-balancing scheduling scheme using the client's IP address and is unrelated to Pll.

Select The Correct Answer Below

Use a WAF to monitor all gift certificate transactions

Disable all gift certificate transactions for cashiers

Implement a discretionary access control policy

Require an approval PIN for the cashier and a separate approval PIN for the manager


### Question Explanation


The Answer: D. Require an approval PIN for the cashier and a separate approval PIN for the manager  
This separation of duties would be categorized as dual control, where two people must be present to perform the business function. In this example, the dual control is managed by using two separate PINs (Personal Identification Numbers) that would not be shared among individuals.  
  
The incorrect answers:  
A. Use a WAF to monitor all gift certificate transactions  
A WAF (Web Application Firewall) is commonly used to monitor the input to web-based applications. WAFs do not commonly ensure separation of duties.  
  
B. Disable all gift certificate transactions for cashiers  
A separation of duties would give each person half of the information needed to complete the transaction, or it would require both persons to be present. Limiting the transaction to one person would not provide any separation between duties.  
  
C. Implement a discretionary access control policy  
A discretionary access control policy (DAC) is commonly used in operating system to allow the data owner to decide who has access to data. A DAC would not provide a way to manage separation of duties.

#### Flancrest Enterprises recently set up a web site utilizing several web servers in a web farm. The web farm spreads the load among the different web servers. Visitor IP addresses are used to ensure that clients always return to the same server during a web session. Which of the following BEST describes this configuration?

Select The Correct Answer Below

Affinity

Round-Robin

Virtual IP

Active-Passive

### Question Explanation


Source address IP affinity scheduling allows a load balancer to direct client requests to the same server during a web session. Round-robin scheduling simply sends each request to the next server. Load balancers can use a virtual IP, but this refers to the IP address of the web server, not the IP address of a visitor. An active-passive configuration has at least one server that is not actively serving clients, but the scenario doesn't indicate any of the servers are in a passive mode.\

Question 41

#### An organization recently updated its security policy. One change is a requirement for all internal web servers to only support HTTPS traffic. However, the organization does not have funds to pay for this. Which of the following is the BEST solution?

Select The Correct Answer Below

Create code signing certificates for the web servers.

Create one wildcard certificate for all the web servers.

Create a public CA and issue certificates from it.

Create certificates signed by an internal private CA.

##### This is the correct answer.

The best solution is to use certificates signed by an internal private Certificate Authority (CA). This ensures connections use Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) instead of HTTP. Even if the organization doesn't have an internal CA, it is possible to create one on an existing server without incurring any additional costs. A code signing certificate provides a digital signature for an application or script, not an entire web server. A wildcard certificate is used for a single domain with multiple subdomains.lt is not used for multiple web servers unless they all share the same root domain name, but the scenario doesn't indicate the web servers share the same root domain name. You would not create a public CA to support internal private servers. While it is feasible to purchase certificates from a public CA, that would cost money, but the scenario indicates money isn't available.


#### Which of the following would be commonly provided by a CASB? (Select TWO)

Select The Correct Answers Below

List of applications in use

Centralized log storage facility

List of network outages for the previous month

Verification of encrypted data transfers
VPN connectivity for remote users

### Question Explanation

_keyboard_arrow_down_

The Answer: B. A list of applications in use  
E. Verification of encrypted data transfers  
A CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) can be used to apply security policies to cloud-based implementations. Two common functions of a CASB are visibility into application use and data security policy use. Other common CASB functions are the verification of compliance with formal standards and the monitoring and identification of threats.  
  
The incorrect answers:  
A. List of all internal Windows devices that have not installed the latest security patches  
A CASB focuses on policies associated with cloud-based services and not internal devices.  
  
C. Centralized log storage facility  
Using Syslog to centralize log storage is most commonly associated with a SIEM (Security Information and Event Manager).  
  
D. List of network outages for the previous month  
A network availability report would be outside the scope of a CASB.  
  
F. VPN connectivity for remote users  


VPN concentrators are commonly used to provide security connectivity for remote users.#### You suspect that an attacker has been sending specially crafted TCP packets to a server trying to exploit a vulnerability. You decide to capture TCP packets being sent to this server for later analysis and you want to use a command-line tool to do so. Which of the following tools will BEST meet your need?

Select The Correct Answer Below

.Wiredump

Tcpdump

Netcat

Nmap

### Question Explanation


The tcpdump command-line tool is the best choice of the given answers. tcpdump is a powerful command-line packet analyzer tool used in Unix-like operating systems (including Linux and macOS) to capture and display network packets on a network interface. It allows you to inspect network traffic in real-time, filter packets based on various criteria, and save the captured data for later analysis. tcpdump is particularly useful for troubleshooting network issues, monitoring network activity, and security analysis.

#### A technician at an MSP has been asked to manage devices on third-party private network. The technician needs command line access to internal routers, switches, and firewalls. Which of the following would provide the necessary access?

Select The Correct Answer Below

HSM

Jump Server

NAC

Air gap

### Question Explanation

The Answer: B. Jump server  
A jump server is a highly secured device commonly used to access secure areas of another network. The technician would first connect to the jump server using SSH or a VPN tunnel, and then "jump" from the jump server to other devices on the inside of the protected network. This would allow technicians at an MSP (Managed Service Provider) to securely access devices on their customer's network.  
  
The incorrect answers:  
A. HSM  
An HSM (Hardware Security Module) is a secure method of cryptographic key backup and hardware-based cryptographic offloading.  
  
C. NAC  
NAC (Network Access Control) is a broad term describing access control based on a health check or posture assessment. NAC will deny access to devices that don't meet the minimum security requirements.  
  
D. Air gap  
An air gap is a segmentation strategy that separates devices or networks by physically disconnecting them from each other.

#### A manufacturing company would like to use an existing router to separate a corporate network and a manufacturing floor that use the same physical switch. The company does not want to install any additional hardware. Which of the following would be the BEST choice for this segmentation?

Select The Correct Answer Below

Connect the corporate network and the manufacturing floor with a VPN

Build an air gapped manufacturing floor network

##### This answer selected is not correct.

Use personal firewalls on each device

Create separate VLANs for the corporate network and the manufacturing floor

##### This is the correct answer.

### Question Explanation

_keyboard_arrow_down_

The Answer: D. Create separate VLANs for the corporate network and the manufacturing floor  
Creating VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) will segment a network without requiring additional switches.  
  
The incorrect answers:  
A. Connect the corporate network and the manufacturing floor with a VPN  
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) would encrypt all information between the two networks, but it would not provide any segmentation. This process would also commonly require additional hardware to provide VPN connectivity.  
  
B. Build an air gapped manufacturing floor network  
An air gapped network would require separate physical switches on each side of the gap, and this would require the purchase of an additional switch.  
  
C. Use personal firewalls on each device  



While personal firewalls provide protection for individual devices, they do not segment networks. It’s also uncommon for personal firewalls to be installed on manufacturing equipment#### A security administrator would like to create an access control where each file or folder is assigned a security clearance level, such as “confidential” or “secret.” The security administrator would then assign a maximum security level to each user. What type of access control would be used in this network?

Select The Correct Answer Below

Mandatory

##### This answer selected is correct.

Rule-based

Discretionary

Role-based

### Question Explanation

_keyboard_arrow_down_

The Answer: A. Mandatory  
Mandatory access control uses a series of security levels (i.e., public, private, secret) and assigns those levels to each object in the operating system. Users are assigned a security level, and they would only have access to objects that meet or are below that assigned security level.  
  
The incorrect answers:  
B. Rule-based  
Rule-based access control determines access based on a series of system- enforced rules. An access rule might require that a particular browser be used to complete a web page form, or that access to a file or system is only allowed during certain times of the day.  
  
C. Discretionary  
Discretionary access control allows the owner of an object to assign access. If a user creates a spreadsheet, the user can then assign users and groups to have a particular level of access to that spreadsheet.  
  
D. Role-based  
Role-based access control assigns a user’s permissions based on their role in the organization. For example, a manager would have a different set of rights and permissions than a team lead.
