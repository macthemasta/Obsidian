Nmap is a Network mapping tool. That means it's used to discover informations about hosts on a network (their ip, open ports, etc). Whereas Netstat is a network statistic tool used to list active connections from and to your computer. 

  
OCSP Stapling improves performance by positioning a digitally-signed and time-stamped version of the OCSP response directly on the webserver.  This stapled OCSP response is then refreshed at predefined intervals set by the CA.  The stapled OCSP response allows the web server to include the OCSP response within the initial SSL handshake, without the need for the user to make a separate external connection to the CA.


- OCSP Stapling improves the connection speed of the SSL handshake by combining two requests into one.  This cuts down on the amount of time it takes to load an encrypted webpage.
- OCSP Stapling helps maintain the privacy of the end user as no connection is made to the CRL for the OCSP request.  Rather than see which websites a user has visited, the CA will only see OCSP requests from the web site and not its users.


Encapsulating _Security_ Payload is a member of the IPsec set of protocols that encrypt and authenticate the packets of data between computers using a VPN.


What is a trusted boot?

A system boot where aspects of the hardware and firmware are measured and compared against known good values to verify their integrity and thus their trustworthiness


What Is RADIUS? Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is **a networking protocol that authorizes and authenticates users who access a remote network**.



**Data loss prevention** (DLP) is a part of a company's overall security strategy that focuses on detecting and preventing the loss, leakage or misuse of data through breaches, ex-filtration transmissions and unauthorized use.



(SLA) is **a contract between a service provider and its customers that documents what services the provider will furnish and defines the service standards the provider is obligated to meet**. A service-level commitment


A dump file is **a snapshot that shows the process that was executing and modules that were loaded for an app at a point in time**.




What is Metasploit used for?

The Metasploit Framework is a Ruby-based, modular penetration testing platform that enables you to write, test, and execute exploit code. The Metasploit Framework contains a suite of tools that you can use to test security vulnerabilities, enumerate networks, execute attacks, and evade detection.



An X. 509 certificate **binds an identity to a public key using a digital signature**. A certificate contains an identity (a hostname, or an organization, or an individual) and a public key (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, ed25519, etc.), and is either signed by a certificate authority or is self-signed.



What is the simple definition of blockchain?

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.


What is Nessus? Nessus is a platform developed by Tenable that **scans for security vulnerabilities in devices, applications, operating systems, cloud services and other network resources**.



What is Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis? The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis is **a model to describe cyber attacks**. It contains 4 parts - adversary, infrastructure, capability, and target. It gives analysts a comprehensive view of cyber attacks. Scientific 


802.1X protocol—An IEEE standard for port-based network access control (PNAC) on wired and wireless access points. 802.1X **defines authentication controls for any user or device trying to access a LAN or WLAN**. NAC—A proven networking concept that identifies users and devices by controlling access to the network.




What is NIST RMF framework?

The Risk Management Framework (RMF), presented in NIST SP 800-37, **provides a disciplined and structured process that integrates information security and risk management activities into the system development life cycle**.



Pulping 
**Pulping Gives You Extra Security**  
  
That means there will be no opportunity for your confidential documents to be reconstructed. They'll be broken down into wood pulp, their ink removed, and then recycled into a variety of products. Talk about document destruction!


Ellipitical Curve - Elliptic Curve Crypotography --> uses smaller keys than non-ECC encryption and has smaller storage and transmission requirements. This makes it a efficient option for mobile devices. 

NetFlow is **a network protocol developed by Cisco for collecting IP traffic information and monitoring network flow**. By analyzing NetFlow data, you can get a picture of network traffic flow and volume.



Key Escrow --> When a 3rd party holds the decryption keys for your data.


DLP --> designed to idenitify sensitive data transfers, capable of blocking them,





TPM-->
