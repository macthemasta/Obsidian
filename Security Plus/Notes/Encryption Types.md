Asymmetric ---->

RSA : (**Rivest–Shamir–Adleman**) is a public-key cryptosystem, one of the oldest that is widely used for secure data transmission.


Diffie Hellman: Algorithm is a key-exchange protocol that enables two parties communicating over public channel to establish a mutual secret without it being transmitted over the Internet. DH enables the two to use a public key to encrypt and decrypt their conversation or data using symmetric cryptography.


ECC:  **a key-based technique for encrypting data**. ECC focuses on pairs of public and private keys for decryption and encryption of web traffic.


Symmetric ---->

AES256:  s a virtually impenetrable symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a 256-bit key to convert your plain text or data into a cipher. The most secure offered today.

Blowfish and TwoFish:  **Twofish is the successor to Blowfish**, and, like its predecessor, uses symmetric encryption, so only one 256-bit key is necessary. This technique is one of the fastest encryption algorithms and is ideal for both hardware and software environments.


DES and 3DES: 3DES Encryption, also known as **Triple Data Encryption Standard** (DES), is a type of cryptography where block cipher algorithms are applied three times to each data block.



Hashing --->

MD5 and SHA1:  **MD5 stands for Message Digest and SHA1 stands for Secure Hash Algorithm** square measure the hashing algorithms wherever The speed of MD5 is fast in comparison of SHA1's speed. However, SHA1 provides more security than MD5.

NTLM: Prone to pass the Hash Vulnerability, has improvements of LANMAN. 

SHA512: is a **cryptographic hash**. "SHA" is an acronym for "Secure Hash Algorithm". SHA512 is the strongest cryptographic hash in the SHA2 family.
