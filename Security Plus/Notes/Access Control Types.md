A. Mandatory  
Mandatory access control uses a series of security levels (i.e., public, private, secret) and assigns those levels to each object in the operating system. Users are assigned a security level, and they would only have access to objects that meet or are below that assigned security level.  
  
  
B. Rule-based  
Rule-based access control determines access based on a series of system- enforced rules. An access rule might require that a particular browser be used to complete a web page form, or that access to a file or system is only allowed during certain times of the day.  
  
C. Discretionary  
Discretionary access control allows the owner of an object to assign access. If a user creates a spreadsheet, the user can then assign users and groups to have a particular level of access to that spreadsheet.  
  
D. Role-based  
Role-based access control assigns a userâ€™s permissions based on their role in the organization. For example, a manager would have a different set of rights and permissions than a team lead.
